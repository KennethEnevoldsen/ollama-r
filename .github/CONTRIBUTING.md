## Contribute to ollamar

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that itâ€™s a problem. 

Fork the repository, create a branch for your changes, and submit a pull request with documented and tested code. Refer to [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan for R package development guidelines.

- We use [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/), with Markdown syntax, for documentation. 
- We use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) for testing. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept. - We use continuous integration and deployment through GitHub and GitHub actions.
